A comparison of Melodie, Mesa and AgentPy.

* Scenario + DataLoader + DataInfo --> complicated data import
* multiple agent lists
* logics in the model are separated into environment, so the micro- and macro-level variables are distinguished
* data_collector is also separated, so more complicated collection mechanisms can be defined, depending on the needs of the data structure in agents and environment.
* all three frameworks has visualization but implemented in different ways, so not covered in the comparison here.
