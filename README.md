A comparison of Melodie, Mesa and AgentPy.

* Scenario + DataLoader + DataInfo --> complicated data import
* multiple agent lists
* logics in the model are separated into environment, so the micro- and macro-level variables are distinguished
* data_collector is also separated, so more complicated collection mechanisms can be defined, depending on the needs of the data structure in agents and environment.
More detailed results are saved (agent-level). So, in case the tables are too long, we use the sqlite database.
* all three frameworks has visualization but implemented in different ways, so not covered in the comparison here.
* melodie has a more systematic conceptualization framework and is better for teaching. For quick development of small scale model, mesa and agentpy might be easier.
